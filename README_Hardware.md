## Introduction

During the ideation stage of our project, we engaged in a thorough evaluation of the feasibility of using microcontrollers or single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi, as the basis for constructing individual data collection devices. The rationale behind this design choice was the high level of flexibility it would offer, allowing us to fine-tune the hardware to precisely match our desired specifications at the fundamental hardware level. However, after extensive discussions, we ultimately concluded that such an approach presented a significant number of issues, which may outweigh the benefits of customization.

The primary drawback of creating hardware from the ground up is that it introduces numerous complexities, making it a challenging task to ensure all components function harmoniously and as intended. This scenario could, in turn, result in extended debugging periods, thereby delaying the project's timeline. As such, to mitigate these potential challenges, we made a strategic decision to leverage widely accessible, highly capable devices for our data collection task. Specifically, we settled on using cell phones, which offer an abundance of computing power and availability, ensuring that almost everyone has access to one.

Given that iOS is more commonly used than Android phones in our target market, we opted to develop the app for iOS first. By utilizing the Flutter framework as the basis for our codebase, we ensured that future expansion to include Android devices would be seamless. This strategy allowed us to prioritize the platform with the most significant user base, which could potentially lead to a more significant impact from our product in the near future.

## Technical Specifications

To ensure optimal functionality and seamless integration with our program, the selected smartphone must satisfy specific technical requirements. Firstly, the smartphone must feature a back-facing main camera capable of capturing images, with a minimum resolution of 8 megapixels or above. This specification will enable the accurate recording of visual data. Secondly, the smartphone must be equipped with an internal accelerometer capable of measuring acceleration in three axes with low delay time and fast update rate. The accelerometer will be critical in capturing and recording data such as motion, vibrations, or other physical movements. Thirdly, the smartphone must include a GPS chip with real-time location tracking capabilities. The GPS chip must have an adequate degree of accuracy, with a margin of error of less than a few meters, to provide geolocation data. Lastly, the selected smartphone must meet the software compatibility requirements, have sufficient storage space, and a stable internet connection when uploading data. Since our project is primarily software-based, a smartphone is the sole hardware requirement for the app to function properly on the user's end. We also recommend the use of a steady mount to affix the smartphone onto the windshield of the user's vehicle for optimal usage.
